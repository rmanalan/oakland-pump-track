## About

Four years in the making in what started as a mid-ride idea between Ryan Gardner and Kevin Smallman, the Oakland Pump Track was completed in the fall of 2020. Kevin, Ryan, and small team of dedicated of Oakland MTBers put in a herculean effort during COVID times to build out this pump track.
